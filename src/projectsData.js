The numbers in the background have a randomly generated order each time the webpage is loaded up.",

Using python, we created an AI blackjack player who would determine the best statistical strategy to profiting in a standard game of blackjack. The \"player\" had no knowledge of the cards left, and used the method of \"card counting\" in order to determine the best possible move. Using statistics and basic mathematics, the bot was able to weigh potential gain and the probability of winning the next hand to determine whether to bet high, and if it should hit/double. The player starts with $10,000, and the program runs for 1,000 games, then displays the results. Because it is all luck based, and house favoured, the player is still likely to lose, however less often.",
